## Contribution to Thailand's NDC

Thailand's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement targets greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Energy efficiency projects registered under T-VER can contribute to these national targets:

- High efficiency scenario could deliver ~51.5% reduction from BAU by 2030
- This represents a significant portion of Thailand's NDC commitment
- T-VER credits from these reductions can be used for:
  - Domestic offsetting under the upcoming carbon tax
  - International voluntary market sales
  - Direct counting towards NDC targets

## Recommendations

1. **Establish T-VER Project Pipeline:** Develop a portfolio of energy efficiency projects aligned with T-VER methodologies
2. **Focus on High-Value Sectors:** Prioritize agriculture and industrial efficiency projects with higher credit prices
3. **Aggregate Small Projects:** Combine smaller projects to reduce transaction costs and achieve price premiums
4. **Integrate with Carbon Tax:** Position energy efficiency projects to benefit from Thailand's planned carbon tax
5. **Enhance MRV Systems:** Invest in robust monitoring, reporting, and verification to maximize credit issuance
6. **Use Carbon Revenue for Repayment:** Dedicate a portion of carbon credit revenue to accelerate loan repayment
7. **Explore Advance Market Commitments:** Secure upfront financing by selling future carbon credits to interested buyers

## Conclusion

The integration of Thailand's T-VER programme with energy efficiency initiatives presents a significant opportunity to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy while generating financial returns. The higher prices for agricultural and forestry credits make these sectors particularly attractive, while the industrial sector offers large volume potential. By strategically developing projects that align with T-VER methodologies and Thailand's NDC commitments, the country can achieve substantial emission reductions while accelerating the repayment of energy efficiency investments.
